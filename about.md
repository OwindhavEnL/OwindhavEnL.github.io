> I don’t regret anything I’ve ever done in life, any choice that I’ve made. But I’m consumed with regret for the things I didn’t do, the > choices I didn’t make, the things I didn’t say. We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the >thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. > “What if…” “If only…” “I wonder what would have…” You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days
